    <h4>Synopsis</h4>
    <p class="csparagraph">The goal of this project was to redesign the existing website for Compass, the public transit company in Vancouver BC. The focus  of the project was addressing the online loading system for the tap card.The system lacks a painless method for commuters to load money or monthly passes onto their tap card. Based on the goals of Compass, my final product attempted to enhance the user experience of the existing site.  </p>

    <h4>Strategy and Planning</h4>
      <p class="csparagraph">The most important step in building a successful product was identifying the goals of Compass, and what they hoped to achieve with the card system. After researching the problem, I concluded that some important goals were increasing revenue, and gaining more monthly pass users. I decided that creating an app prototype would be the best way to achieve these goals. The target audience of Compass ridership is commuters between the ages of 25-35. Given that most of these people have smartphones, a simple responsive mobile app would easily allow the target ridership to load money onto their tap card, as well as upgrade to monthly passes.  </p>

      <p class="csparagraph">Pictured below is a gap analysis that displays features of other major transportation companies in comparable cities. I concluded that a major gap for Vancouver's system is the lack of mobile app. </p>

      <p class="csparagraph">After conducting research, I began to organize the content to figure out the most painless way to move through each process. I wanted the user to have minimal amounts of clicks to complete any necessary task. I experimented with many sketches and post it notes before I found a good flow.  </p>

    <h4>Design</h4>
      <p class="csparagraph">The design of the prototype is focused around easily clickable buttons and legible fonts. The basic structure allows the user to click exactly which button they want, and not be distracted by too much information on the page. The large radio buttons, simple fonts, and high-contrasted colors create an accessible experience for those who may be visually impaired. The functionality is prioritized over the beauty of the design.
